## Project Motivation
Customer churn rate is one of the key metrics for a lot of companies. What is churn rate? It is the number of users that
have stopped using an app. Why is it so important? Because it costs more to acquire new customers than retain old customers.
In this final project of Udacity Data Scientist Nano Degree, I used all the skills learnt throughout this course to
build a model that predicts whether a user will churn or not.

## File Descriptions
```
|--Sparkify.ipynb: this contains codes for modeling on mini dataset
|--main.py: this contains codes for modeling on the big dataset using AWS
```
## Results
Results and discussions can be found in the post available [here](https://medium.com/@kwok723/predict-customer-churn-rate-with-apache-spark-39c83a8f4940).
